    <h1 class="mb-4">About North Carolina Animal Advocates United (NCAAU)</h1>

    <p>We are a grassroots, loosely organized group of activists interested in furthering animal rights in North Carolina. 

By "animal rights" we mean anything that reduces the suffering and exploitation of all non-human animals. While we support animal liberation in its entirety, we understand and support welfare initiatives that help meet our goal.

As a collective that's loosely organized, we can align ourselves with any animal rights work orchestrated by another organization or individual. We are also empowered to pursue our own actions and activism as we see fit. All campaigns and actions are encouraged so long as they adhere to our core values and code of conduct.

To be a member of NCAAU is simply to adhere to our code of conduct and core values. Any break from these values by an individual is considered to be a resignation from the organization.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Our Core Values</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Nonviolence: In order to achieve a violence-free society for all animals, we must use a love-based, nonviolent approach to our activism. Through kindness and love, we can create a positive change.</li>
      <li>Abolition: The goal is to ultimately end the exploitation and suffering of all animals, however, we also recognize that reform is necessary to help us reach this goal. Non-human animals have the right to a life free of suffering. We denounce speciesism.</li>
      <li>Diversity: We recognize and welcome diversity of our members, supporters, and people who oppose our organization. Everyone is welcome here, and we accept people at all stages in their journey to adopt a more compassionate life. We have a zero-tolerance policy for oppression of any form toward non-human animals and humans, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, etc.</li>
      <li>Mental Health: We strongly value the mental wellbeing of our activists, and recognize that grief, trauma, and/or burnout are difficult to avoid when fighting to end the suffering of all non-human animals. It is our goal to provide a safe, judgment-free space where mental health resources are easily accessible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Activism Code of Conduct</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>We conduct our activism in a peaceful, nonviolent manner. Always.</li>
        <li>We are inclusive. Anyone is welcome to join our events, regardless of their activism experience and where they are in their journey to live a more compassionate life.</li>
        <li>We recognize, appreciate, and respect that our members and supporters have diverse backgrounds and experiences.</li>
        <li>We denounce hate of any kind, regardless of whether or not we agree with someone's beliefs or actions toward animals.</li>
        <li>NCAAU aims to end animal exploitation both institutionally and individually. Although one is not required to be vegan to participate in NCAAU, our policy is that participants refrain from eating or purchasing animal products such as meat, dairy, and eggs during all of our events, including but not limited to post-protest restaurant gatherings and other impromptu events involving NCAAU members. This ensures we stand by our mission, and everyone can feel comfortable and welcome at the table.</li>
    </ul>
